There are different methods of terminal connections. Listed below are a few options you can select in choosing which Terminal application tool you would like to use:

1. [From a PC using Putty](#30-access-from-your-pc-using-putty)
2. [From a PC using Mobaxterm (which mimics the behavior of Linux)](#40-access-from-your-pc-via-mobaxterm-or-from-linux-terminal)
3. From a Linux console (either a native Linux machine or client Linux machine)



## 3.0 Access from your PC via MobaXterm or from Linux Terminal

**MobaXterm** is an enhanced terminal for Windows with an X11 server, a tabbed SSH client and several other network tools for remote computing (VNC, RDP, telnet, rlogin). **MobaXterm** brings all the essential Unix commands to Windows desktop, in a single portable exe file which works out of the box and makes your Windows PC look like a UNIX environment. If you are already running a native Linux or client running Linux, you don't need to load MobaXterm.

### 3.1 Install MobaXterm

1. Download the MobaXterm free edition: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html Note: get the installer edition, not the portable edition. (The installer edition will enable you to save login profiles.) . Download zipfile, open it and click on the msi file to install Mobaxterm.

   ![mobaxterm_edition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715527-3fee6500-f987-11e9-8961-6c0a38163bfc.png)

### 3.2 Open Local Terminal 

1. Launch MobaXterm using the installer. You should see the following:

![mobaxterm_window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715801-c5721500-f987-11e9-95e0-bdf9f76b7f43.png)

2. Left click: **"Start local terminal"**. Within this console you can see your local PC based files using standard Linux operating system commands (ls, cd, vi and etc.). 

   If you are on the Intel network and can't login, be sure to disable your VPN and use connectivity outside Intel's firewall (for example using Employee Hotspot at an Intel campus). **The welcome email link will only work outside of Intel firewall.** 

   Separate instructions for login inside the Intel firewall are below. 

   1. Navigate around with cd (change directory) and ls (list) you will recognize your Windows folders and files accessible through a UNIX interface. 

   Return to home by typing cd.

![mobaxterm_terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715875-e76b9780-f987-11e9-9c4a-9eb48fb06915.png)

### 3.3 Downloading an SSH key

**For the MobaXterm flow, native LINUX flow or macOS, click on the link Linux or macOS and follow the steps as stated in the welcome email.**

To start the process:

1. Click on the first link in the welcome email (might need to use an incognito window if you have issues launching or clear cookies).
2. If you are a first time user, you will see a "Terms and Conditions" page come up. Please click "accept" on the T&C's to proceed.
3. You will then come to a new screen asking to select "Learn" or "Connect", please select "Connect".
4. The following page will then be displayed. Click on âLinux* or MAC OSâ under the "Connect with a Terminal" button.

![ssh_key_access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715899-f3eff000-f987-11e9-9b1c-5ad2ba2a96ea.png)

6. After clicking â**SSH key for Linux/macOS**â, you will get instructions on accessing a UNIX key file. 

7. Click the button "SSH Key for Linux/macOS."

8. In your mobaxterm terminal, check if you have a .ssh directory. 

   ```
   ls -a
   ```

9. Look for the .ssh directory. If it doesn't exist type: 

   ```
   mkdir .ssh
   ```

10. Copy the devcloud-access-key to your .ssh directory. 

11. Add the following lines to files ~/.ssh/config:

    ```
    Host c009 
    User u12345
    IdentityFile ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt
    ProxyCommand ssh -T -i ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key12345.txt guest@devcloud.intel.com	
    ```

    If you saved your key in a location other than ~/Downloads/, insert the correct path and the correct user number that was provided to you in the email. 

    12. Set the correct restrictive permissions on the private SSH. Run the following commands in terminal: 

        ```
        chmod 600 ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key-u12345.txt
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
        ```



Should MobaXterm fail to launch after working for a period of time, we have seen a few cases requiring a reinstall. Prior to removal and re-install, copy the folder MobaXterm from your Documents directory to a new name. Under the directory Mobaxterm/home you will have the .ssh folder and .bashrc file. Reinstall Mobaxterm and copy these files over to the new install if you have customized these files.



Type the following and the move to the next section. 

```
ssh c009
```



## 4.0 Accessing high powered servers running FPGA development software

### 4.1 Understanding available resources

You are now logged in to machine called login-l (headnode). You cannot run compute jobs here. You need to run compute jobs on a powerful server.  

The following nodes can run Quartus, OpenCL and HLS: n130-n139.

In addition, the following nodes can run OPAE connectivity to PAC Cards: n137-n139.

There are a total of 12 Arria 10 PAC Cards, 4 each on n137, n138 and n139. 

To query if free nodes are available run the below command on the login server (headnode). The terminology that we will use is localnode (your PC), headnode (login node) and computenode. The computenode is a high power machine for running compilations - a subset host PAC cards: n137, n138 and n139. 

```
pbsnodes -s v-qsvr-fpga | grep -B 4 fpga
```

You will get a listing of free and busy nodes that connect to PAC cards. 

```
pbsnodes -l free 	# lists all free nodes (only nodes 130-139 run x2go)
```

If there is a free node, when you execute this command you will be logged in to a new machine within a minute or so. If no machine is available, you will be placed in a queue.

To login to a specific machine:

```
qsub -q batch@v-qsvr-fpga -I -l nodes=s001-n137:ppn=2 (for 137 through 139)
qsub -l nodes=s001-n130:ppn=2 (for 130 through 136)
```

When launching the qsub command, you can request additional memory with the following command. Note: Each job takes 2 slots, so when you request 10G, it's actually 10G*2 = 20GB.

```
-l h_vmem=10G
```

Once you have completed this step, you have a high power machine available for powerful computing jobs. You only have a console available but no graphics available. Note that mobaxterm has multiple tabs has three possibilities of where to be logged in: 

- Local Machine (eg. llandis-MOBL)
- devcloud login-l login server
- compute server (eg n137)

You need to be cognizant of which Mobaxterm tab and machine you are typing in so that you are aware of which commands you type in which Mobaxterm tab.

2. At this point you will want to run a PC based product called **X2Go client** that will allow you to have a Linux based GUI that allows multiple terminals and can run graphics programs such as Intel Quartus. In order to run GUI based applications such as Quartus and Modelsim, you will need to download an application on your PC called X2Go. X2Go is the remedy for slow graphics response from Mobaxterm running X11 or VNC windowing systems.

Next, setup the tunneling to the X2Go client using the following command: 

***Note: n137 can be replaced with other available nodes. Adjust names and paths according to yourown setup.*** Open a second tab on Mobaxterm and type:

```
ssh -L 4002:s001-n137:22 colfax-intel
```

![step2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716181-9314e780-f988-11e9-9bb3-2954946864c0.png)


## 5.0 Loading and launching X2Go

To download X2Go, navigate to this link on your PC browser: https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start

Grab the **MS Windows version** â click where the cursor is in the screenshot below <u>**(mswin)**</u>:

![launching_x2go](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716221-a6c04e00-f988-11e9-97a6-bae636d8732b.png)

Go through the install steps for the mswin X2Go Client and accept all.

On your MobaXterm window, open a second session tab by clicking on the "+" as shown below:![extra_tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716260-b2ac1000-f988-11e9-8e44-945391aa8555.png)

This tab will a launch terminal running UNIX commands on your local machine.

To open the port for graphics usage, in the new terminal with your PC host name prompt type. Note that you will need to match or replace the hostname n137 listed below with the machine name that was allocated to you. If you are on the Intel firewall, replace c009 with colfax-intel.

![graphics_usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716435-0a4a7b80-f989-11e9-82bd-456aec75cb6b.png)

Launch the x2go application on your PC. Set up the new session with the following settings substituting the Login field <uxxxx> with your own assigned user name and the path to the RSA/DSA key for ssh connection. Note this is the same key referenced for Mobaxterm connection that enables ssh c009.

![x2go_session_preferences](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716674-8218a600-f989-11e9-8303-2dffc22f09b5.png)

The input/output screen has a setting for the display size which can be adjusted depending on your screen size. If you desire a different screen size adjust the parameters on this panel accordingly. To determine what DPI to use for your monitor, type the following command in a MobaXterm terminal: 

```
xdpyinfo | grep dot
```

![x2go_session_size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716702-8c3aa480-f989-11e9-9575-d28c218bc225.png)

To launch the application, hit **OK** to save the settings and then click on the puffy icon New session to launch a graphics session.

![x2go_launch_puffy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716724-95c40c80-f989-11e9-94a8-8b1029e5e70f.png)

After a minute or so, you should see the X2GO screen, be patient. While waiting for X2GO to launch you will see a screen that looks like this:

![x2go_loading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716770-a5435580-f989-11e9-987a-07b0ff0f3808.png)

You might get the following message If you previously logged into a different machine:

![host_key_verification_terminate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716812-b55b3500-f989-11e9-8c60-9c0eaaee2172.png)

Enter **No**

![host_key_verification_update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716830-bee49d00-f989-11e9-86b4-5aee8f792b5e.png)

Then another dialog box will appear, enter **Yes**,

You will see a window that looks like the following.

![x2go_desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716843-c60bab00-f989-11e9-9d99-2fbbdcfce6d9.png)

Should X2GO fail to launch, check that you ran the tunneling command on Mobaxterm on your local host. Make sure that the firewall is turned off per steps described above.

Upon gaining access to the windowing system,  right click within in the desktop and select âOpen Terminal Hereâ.

![open_terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716892-dfacf280-f989-11e9-9d36-6e6c895c363e.png)

Your GUI ready environment should  be similar to the following image:![x2go_terminal_window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716915-efc4d200-f989-11e9-93ee-1726923a0a93.png)

To change the font sizing of the Desktop files in **Desktop Settings** under the **Icons** tab. Select â**Use custom font size**â and change it to 5 or to your font size preference.

**<u>For future access to the Devcloud and to make this log-in experience shorter without the need of typing the lengthy qsub and ssh commands, complete the following steps outlined here:</u>**

[Setup Devcloud Login Script Instructions](https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/blob/master/main/Public_Devcloud_Access_Instructions/LoginScript/README.md)

## 6.0 Quartus Access and Setup

From a terminal that is logged in to the devcloud, type the following: 

```
cp /glob/development-tools/versions/intelFPGA_lite/quartus_setup.sh ~
```

This script has what you need to setup environment variables and paths to the Intel FPGA development tools. There are some variables that need to be edited inside the script to give you access to either Quartus Prime Pro or Quartus Prime Lite, HLS, OpenCL, or Acceleration Stack.

Set those variables according to you desired setup, and source quartus_setup.sh (note: ~/quartus_setup.sh as an executable does not work, you must source this file) . Feel free to adjust your .bashrc and other associated scripts to source quartus_setup.sh inside those startup scripts. **Append the "source ~/quartus_setup.sh" command to the end of the .bashrc file.** 

If the Quartus font appears too zoomed in, as shown below, complete the following:

Under the Tools tab on the Main Bar, select Options. In the General Category, select âFontsâ and change the text size to 6.

![quartus_options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717114-55b15980-f98a-11e9-857e-8c8f5d572d51.png)

## 7.0 Transferring Files to the Devcloud 

**There are three different ways to Transfer Files to the Devcloud:** 

1. [From a Local PC to DevCloud Server in X2Go Terminal (9.1)](#91-transferring-files-to-the-devcloud-with-scp)
2. [MobaXterm User Session (9.2)](#92-Using-MobaXterm-to-Transfer-Files)
3. [WinSCP Application (9.3)](#93-Using-WinSCP-to-Transfer-Files)

### 7.1 Transferring Files to the Devcloud with SCP 

Refer to the login instructions welcome page on file transfer to/from c009. **Use the local terminal on your PC to transfer files. Note: If on Intel firewall, replace c009 with colfax-intel.**

Transferring Files from your localnode terminal. Your prompt on mobaxterm would be of the form: /home/mobaxterm (localnode)

```
scp /path/to/local/file c009:/path/to/remote/directory
```

From headnode or computenode to the localnode. 

```
scp c009:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory
```

Here is an example:

```
scp /drives/c/User/llandis/Documents/file.txt c009:/home/u27224
```

*Note: If on the Intel firewall, replace **c009** with **colfax-intel**.*

### 7.2 Using MobaXterm to Transfer Files

MobaXterm can be used to transfer files to and from your local PC to the Devcloud server.

<u>**To setup this feature, make sure that you have completed all the steps to connect to the DevCloud.**</u>

1. In the main toolbar of MobaXterm, click the **Session** button. ![mobaxterm_new_session](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717144-65c93900-f98a-11e9-870b-784e76806a7f.png)
2. Select **SSH**. ![mobaxterm_ssh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717168-6d88dd80-f98a-11e9-987a-3d226b109886.png)
3. Enter the following information:

## 8.0 Job Control on the X2GO Window

This section provides information on how to terminate jobs on the Devcloud. 

### 8.1 Searching for Free Nodes

You might need to terminate jobs on the Devcloud.  To see what nodes are tied up, from the headnode, type the following: 

```
psbnodes -s v-qsvr-fpga | grep -B 4 fpga
```

### 8.2 Submitting Jobs for a Specified Walltime

A user will be kicked off a node if they have been using it for longer than 6 hours. To submit a job with a specified walltime longer than 6 hours (for compilations longer than 6 hours), type the following after qsub-ing into a specified node:

```
qsub -l walltime=<insert-time> 'command/bash file to be executed'
qsub -l walltime=12:00:00 walltime.sh		# example of a file to be executed
-------------------------------= walltime.sh ------------------------------
# begin walltime.sh
sleep 11h											# sleep command equivalent to a quartus compilation file requiring 11 hours of compilation
													# alternatively, sleep 11h would be quartus_sh commands (i.e. quartus_sh --flow main.v) 	
echo job success > ~/Documents/walltime_log.txt		# exit sleep at 11:00:00, output "job success" to walltime_log.txt
```

### 8.3 Report Status for Jobs Running on the Devcloud

To report the status of your jobs running on the DevCloud is to type the following:

```
qstat -s batch@v-qsvr-fpga
qstat -u u30330 		#change the username according to your id	
qstat -f <job id> 		# 390965 is an example of a job id - (qstat -f 390965)
```

### 8.4 Deleting Jobs on the Devcloud

Jobs can be terminated with the following command: 

```
qdel -s batch@v-qsvr-fpga <job-id>
```

**This is not recommended** but it is a another technique to delete a job from the headnode. Type the following and look for the qsub commands:

```
ps -auxw 
```

Free up the node with the following command: 

```
kill <job-id>
```



## 9.0 Launching Quartus

The following command will launch the Quartus GUI: 

```
quartus &
```

The version you launch (Lite vs Pro) is dependent on the environment variables you set and sourced in the quartus_setup.sh script.

## 10.0 Launching the HLS compiler

If you specify HLS=:"TRUE" in the quartus_setup.sh setup script you will be able to access the HLS compiler, i++. The simplest test would be i++ hello_world.cpp. 

## 11.0 Launching the OpenCL compiler

If you specify OPENCL=:"TRUE" in the tool setup script you will be able to access the OpenCL compiler, aoc. (Needs update for acceleration stack and connectivity to A10 PAC card)

## 12.0 Communicating to the PAC card 

To list all SYSFS entries in a multi-PAC system (explain)

```
ls -l /sys/class/fpga/intel-fpga-dev.?/device
```

To view serial number for a particular SYSFS entry (what does this mean)

```
hexdump -C /sys/class/fpga/intel-fpga-dev.2/intel-fpga-fme.2/intel-pac-hssi.?.auto/hssi_mgmt/eeprom
```

Note when running the Acceleration Stack Commands that communicate with the PAC Card, you will need python 2 in your search path. When initially creating your account, the /etc/skel/.bash_profile file is copied from the headnode to your account. This file specifies python3 first in the path. Switch your ~/.bash_profile to select python2 in your path within this file.

**Another method to see available cards:**

```
lspci | grep accel
```

View the various available cards and select a free one.

![lspci_grep](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717938-ee94a480-f98b-11e9-9209-5acf76a3ec9b.png)

**To download a green bit stream (.gbs):*

```
fpgaconf -B 0x3b hello.gbs
```

This link to the acceleration hub is an excellent resource for further information: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/solutions/acceleration-hub/acceleration-stack.html .

### 3.2 Open Local Terminal 

1. Launch MobaXterm using the installer. You should see the following:

![mobaxterm_window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715801-c5721500-f987-11e9-95e0-bdf9f76b7f43.png)

2. Left click: **"Start local terminal"**. Within this console you can see your local PC based files using standard Linux operating system commands (ls, cd, vi and etc.). 

   If you are on the Intel network and can't login, be sure to disable your VPN and use connectivity outside Intel's firewall (for example using Employee Hotspot at an Intel campus). **The welcome email link will only work outside of Intel firewall.** 
   
   Separate instructions for login inside the Intel firewall are below. 
   
   1. Navigate around with cd (change directory) and ls (list) you will recognize your Windows folders and files accessible through a UNIX interface. 
   
   Return to home by typing cd.

![mobaxterm_terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715875-e76b9780-f987-11e9-9c4a-9eb48fb06915.png)

### 3.3 Downloading an SSH key

**For the MobaXterm flow, native LINUX flow or macOS, click on the link Linux or macOS and follow the steps as stated in the welcome email.**

To start the process:

1. Click on the first link in the welcome email (might need to use an incognito window if you have issues launching or clear cookies).
2.  If you are a first time user, you will see a "Terms and Conditions" page come up. Please click "accept" on the T&C's to proceed.
3. You will then come to a new screen asking to select "Learn" or "Connect", please select "Connect".
4. The following page will then be displayed. Click on âLinux* or MAC OSâ under the "Connect with a Terminal" button.

![ssh_key_access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715899-f3eff000-f987-11e9-9b1c-5ad2ba2a96ea.png)

6. After clicking â**SSH key for Linux/macOS**â, you will get instructions on accessing a UNIX key file. 

7. Click the button "SSH Key for Linux/macOS."

8. In your mobaxterm terminal, check if you have a .ssh directory. 

   ```
   ls -a
   ```
   
9. Look for the .ssh directory. If it doesn't exist type: 

   ```
   mkdir .ssh
   ```

10. Copy the devcloud-access-key to your .ssh directory. 

11. Add the following lines to files ~/.ssh/config:

    ```
    Host c009 
    User u12345
    IdentityFile ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt
    ProxyCommand ssh -T -i ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key12345.txt guest@devcloud.intel.com	
    ```

    If you saved your key in a location other than ~/Downloads/, insert the correct path and the correct user number that was provided to you in the email. 

    12. Set the correct restrictive permissions on the private SSH. Run the following commands in terminal: 

        ```
        chmod 600 ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key-u12345.txt
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
        ```



Should MobaXterm fail to launch after working for a period of time, we have seen a few cases requiring a reinstall. Prior to removal and re-install, copy the folder MobaXterm from your Documents directory to a new name. Under the directory Mobaxterm/home you will have the .ssh folder and .bashrc file. Reinstall Mobaxterm and copy these files over to the new install if you have customized these files.



Type the following and the move to the next section. 

```
ssh c009
```

## 4.0 Access to the Devcloud from within the Intel firewall

### 4.1 Add SOcket CAT Package

1. You will need to modify your MobaXterm setup. Go to the packages icon and left-click.

   ![packages_icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716101-6234b280-f988-11e9-972a-7c13370e1adc.png)

   Your next step you will see the MobApt package manager for MobaXterm:

   ![socat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716113-6b258400-f988-11e9-828a-83c74b051b91.png)

3. Install the **socat package**. This will take approximately 9 minutes to install.

### 4.2  Preparing Configuration file

1. Back in the LINUX (or Mobaxterm) initial screen, you will need to make additional entries into your config file:

```
Host colfax-intel-proxy
User guest
hostname cluster.colfaxresearch.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/colfax-access-key-27224
ProxyCommand socat STDIO SOCKS4:proxy-us.intel.com:%h:%p,socksport=1080

Host colfax-intel-proxy-shell colfax-intel
#replace with your own user name
User u27224 
hostname c009
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/colfax-access-key-27224
ProxyCommand ssh -T colfax-intel-proxy
```

2. At your local machine prompt type: 

```
ssh colfax-intel
```

You will now be logged in:

![step1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716160-885a5280-f988-11e9-8e8e-bee5b0bf2a21.png)

### 4.3 Add Tunnel for Display

1. Refer to section 6 of the instructions to login to a high power compute node. Then return to this section.
2. ***Note: n137 can be replaced with other available nodes. Adjust names and paths according to your own setup.*** Open a second tab on Mobaxterm and type:

```
ssh -L 4002:s001-n137:22 colfax-intel
```

![step2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716181-9314e780-f988-11e9-9bb3-2954946864c0.png)



## 5.0 Accessing high powered servers running FPGA development software

### 5.1 Understanding available resources

You are now logged in to machine called login-l (headnode). You cannot run compute jobs here. You need to run compute jobs on a powerful server.  

The following nodes can run Quartus, OpenCL and HLS: n130-n139.

In addition, the following nodes can run OPAE connectivity to PAC Cards: n137-n139.

There are a total of 12 Arria 10 PAC Cards, 4 each on n137, n138 and n139. 

To query if free nodes are available run the below command on the login server (headnode). The terminology that we will use is localnode (your PC), headnode (login node) and computenode. The computenode is a high power machine for running compilations - a subset host PAC cards: n137, n138 and n139. 

```
pbsnodes -s v-qsvr-fpga | grep -B 4 fpga
```

You will get a listing of free and busy nodes that connect to PAC cards. 

```
pbsnodes -l free 	# lists all free nodes (only nodes 130-139 run x2go)
```

If there is a free node, when you execute this command you will be logged in to a new machine within a minute or so. If no machine is available, you will be placed in a queue.

To login to a specific machine:

```
qsub -q batch@v-qsvr-fpga -I -l nodes=s001-n137:ppn=2 (for 137 through 139)
qsub -l nodes=s001-n130:ppn=2 (for 130 through 136)
```
When launching the qsub command, you can request additional memory with the following command. Note: Each job takes 2 slots, so when you request 10G, it's actually 10G*2 = 20GB.
```
-l h_vmem=10G
```

Once you have completed this step, you have a high power machine available for powerful computing jobs. You only have a console available but no graphics available. Note that mobaxterm has multiple tabs has three possibilities of where to be logged in: 

- Local Machine (eg. llandis-MOBL)
- devcloud login-l login server
- compute server (eg n137)

You need to be cognizant of which Mobaxterm tab and machine you are typing in so that you are aware of which commands you type in which Mobaxterm tab.

2. At this point you will want to run a PC based product called **X2Go client** that will allow you to have a Linux based GUI that allows multiple terminals and can run graphics programs such as Intel Quartus. In order to run GUI based applications such as Quartus and Modelsim, you will need to download an application on your PC called X2Go. X2Go is the remedy for slow graphics response from Mobaxterm running X11 or VNC windowing systems.

## 6.0 Loading and launching X2Go

To download X2Go, navigate to this link on your PC browser: https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start

Grab the **MS Windows version** â click where the cursor is in the screenshot below <u>**(mswin)**</u>:

![launching_x2go](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716221-a6c04e00-f988-11e9-97a6-bae636d8732b.png)

Go through the install steps for the mswin X2Go Client and accept all.

On your MobaXterm window, open a second session tab by clicking on the "+" as shown below:![extra_tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716260-b2ac1000-f988-11e9-8e44-945391aa8555.png)

This tab will a launch terminal running UNIX commands on your local machine.

To open the port for graphics usage, in the new terminal with your PC host name prompt type. Note that you will need to match or replace the hostname n137 listed below with the machine name that was allocated to you. If you are on the Intel firewall, replace c009 with colfax-intel.

![graphics_usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716435-0a4a7b80-f989-11e9-82bd-456aec75cb6b.png)

Launch the x2go application on your PC. Set up the new session with the following settings substituting the Login field <uxxxx> with your own assigned user name and the path to the RSA/DSA key for ssh connection. Note this is the same key referenced for Mobaxterm connection that enables ssh c009.

![x2go_session_preferences](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716674-8218a600-f989-11e9-8303-2dffc22f09b5.png)

The input/output screen has a setting for the display size which can be adjusted depending on your screen size. If you desire a different screen size adjust the parameters on this panel accordingly. To determine what DPI to use for your monitor, type the following command in a MobaXterm terminal: 
```
xdpyinfo | grep dot
```

![x2go_session_size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716702-8c3aa480-f989-11e9-9575-d28c218bc225.png)

To launch the application, hit **OK** to save the settings and then click on the puffy icon New session to launch a graphics session.

![x2go_launch_puffy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716724-95c40c80-f989-11e9-94a8-8b1029e5e70f.png)

After a minute or so, you should see the X2GO screen, be patient. While waiting for X2GO to launch you will see a screen that looks like this:

![x2go_loading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716770-a5435580-f989-11e9-987a-07b0ff0f3808.png)

You might get the following message If you previously logged into a different machine:

![host_key_verification_terminate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716812-b55b3500-f989-11e9-8c60-9c0eaaee2172.png)

Enter **No**

![host_key_verification_update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716830-bee49d00-f989-11e9-86b4-5aee8f792b5e.png)

Then another dialog box will appear, enter **Yes**,

You will see a window that looks like the following.

![x2go_desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716843-c60bab00-f989-11e9-9d99-2fbbdcfce6d9.png)

Should X2GO fail to launch, check that you ran the tunneling command on Mobaxterm on your local host. Make sure that the firewall is turned off per steps described above.

Upon gaining access to the windowing system,  right click within in the desktop and select âOpen Terminal Hereâ.

![open_terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716892-dfacf280-f989-11e9-9d36-6e6c895c363e.png)

Your GUI ready environment should  be similar to the following image:![x2go_terminal_window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716915-efc4d200-f989-11e9-93ee-1726923a0a93.png)

To change the font sizing of the Desktop files in **Desktop Settings** under the **Icons** tab. Select â**Use custom font size**â and change it to 5 or to your font size preference.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716947-03703880-f98a-11e9-9b5f-e3b2b7eb79ad.png" alt="x2go_change_font" style="zoom: 80%;" />![x2go_fontsize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717026-27cc1500-f98a-11e9-9b01-f98c9a1a2d83.png)



**<u>For future access to the Devcloud and to make this log-in experience shorter without the need of typing the lengthy qsub and ssh commands, complete the following steps outlined here:</u>**

[Setup Devcloud Login Script Instructions](https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/blob/master/main/Public_Devcloud_Access_Instructions/LoginScript/README.md)

## 7.0 Quartus Access and Setup

From a terminal that is logged in to the devcloud, type the following: 

```
cp /glob/development-tools/versions/intelFPGA_lite/quartus_setup.sh ~
```

This script has what you need to setup environment variables and paths to the Intel FPGA development tools. There are some variables that need to be edited inside the script to give you access to either Quartus Prime Pro or Quartus Prime Lite, HLS, OpenCL, or Acceleration Stack.

Set those variables according to you desired setup, and source quartus_setup.sh (note: ~/quartus_setup.sh as an executable does not work, you must source this file) . Feel free to adjust your .bashrc and other associated scripts to source quartus_setup.sh inside those startup scripts. **Append the "source ~/quartus_setup.sh" command to the end of the .bashrc file.** 

If the Quartus font appears too zoomed in, as shown below, complete the following:

Under the Tools tab on the Main Bar, select Options. In the General Category, select âFontsâ and change the text size to 6.

![quartus_options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717114-55b15980-f98a-11e9-857e-8c8f5d572d51.png)

## 8.0 Transferring Files to the Devcloud 

**There are three different ways to Transfer Files to the Devcloud:** 

1. [From a Local PC to DevCloud Server in X2Go Terminal (9.1)](#91-transferring-files-to-the-devcloud-with-scp)
2. [MobaXterm User Session (9.2)](#92-Using-MobaXterm-to-Transfer-Files)
3. [WinSCP Application (9.3)](#93-Using-WinSCP-to-Transfer-Files)

### 8.1 Transferring Files to the Devcloud with SCP 

Refer to the login instructions welcome page on file transfer to/from c009. **Use the local terminal on your PC to transfer files. Note: If on Intel firewall, replace c009 with colfax-intel.**

Transferring Files from your localnode terminal. Your prompt on mobaxterm would be of the form: /home/mobaxterm (localnode)

```
scp /path/to/local/file c009:/path/to/remote/directory
```

From headnode or computenode to the localnode. 

```
scp c009:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory
```

Here is an example:

```
scp /drives/c/User/llandis/Documents/file.txt c009:/home/u27224
```

*Note: If on the Intel firewall, replace **c009** with **colfax-intel**.*

### 8.2 Using MobaXterm to Transfer Files

MobaXterm can be used to transfer files to and from your local PC to the Devcloud server.

<u>**To setup this feature, make sure that you have completed all the steps to connect to the DevCloud.**</u>

1. In the main toolbar of MobaXterm, click the **Session** button. ![mobaxterm_new_session](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67717144-65c93900-f98a-11e9-870b-784e76806a7f.png)

## 9.0 Job Control on the X2GO Window

This section provides information on how to terminate jobs on the Devcloud. 

### 9.1 Searching for Free Nodes

You might need to terminate jobs on the Devcloud.  To see what nodes are tied up, from the headnode, type the following: 

```
psbnodes -s v-qsvr-fpga | grep -B 4 fpga
```

### 9.2 Submitting Jobs for a Specified Walltime

A user will be kicked off a node if they have been using it for longer than 6 hours. To submit a job with a specified walltime longer than 6 hours (for compilations longer than 6 hours), type the following after qsub-ing into a specified node:

```
qsub -l walltime=<insert-time> 'command/bash file to be executed'
qsub -l walltime=12:00:00 walltime.sh		# example of a file to be executed
-------------------------------= walltime.sh ------------------------------
# begin walltime.sh
sleep 11h											# sleep command equivalent to a quartus compilation file requiring 11 hours of compilation
													# alternatively, sleep 11h would be quartus_sh commands (i.e. quartus_sh --flow main.v) 	
echo job success > ~/Documents/walltime_log.txt		# exit sleep at 11:00:00, output "job success" to walltime_log.txt
```

### 9.3 Report Status for Jobs Running on the Devcloud

To report the status of your jobs running on the DevCloud is to type the following:

```
qstat -s batch@v-qsvr-fpga
qstat -u u30330 		#change the username according to your id	
qstat -f <job id> 		# 390965 is an example of a job id - (qstat -f 390965)
```

### 9.4 Deleting Jobs on the Devcloud

Jobs can be terminated with the following command: 

```
qdel -s batch@v-qsvr-fpga <job-id>
```

**This is not recommended** but it is a another technique to delete a job from the headnode. Type the following and look for the qsub commands:

```
ps -auxw 
```

Free up the node with the following command: 

```
kill <job-id>
```



## 10.0 Launching Quartus

The following command will launch the Quartus GUI: 

```
quartus &
```

The version you launch (Lite vs Pro) is dependent on the environment variables you set and sourced in the quartus_setup.sh script.

## 11.0 Launching the HLS compiler

If you specify HLS=:"TRUE" in the quartus_setup.sh setup script you will be able to access the HLS compiler, i++. The simplest test would be i++ hello_world.cpp. 

## 12.0 Launching the OpenCL compiler

If you specify OPENCL=:"TRUE" in the tool setup script you will be able to access the OpenCL compiler, aoc. (Needs update for acceleration stack and connectivity to A10 PAC card)

## 13.0 Communicating to the PAC card 

To list all SYSFS entries in a multi-PAC system (explain)

```
ls -l /sys/class/fpga/intel-fpga-dev.?/device
```

To view serial number for a particular SYSFS entry (what does this mean)

```
hexdump -C /sys/class/fpga/intel-fpga-dev.2/intel-fpga-fme.2/intel-pac-hssi.?.auto/hssi_mgmt/eeprom
```

Note when running the Acceleration Stack Commands that communicate with the PAC Card, you will need python 2 in your search path. When initially creating your account, the /etc/skel/.bash_profile file is copied from the headnode to your account. This file specifies python3 first in the path. Switch your ~/.bash_profile to select python2 in your path within this file.

**Another method to see available cards:**

```
lspci | grep accel
```

View the various available cards and select a free one.

**To download a green bit stream (.gbs):*

```
fpgaconf -B 0x3b hello.gbs
```

## 16.0 Timeouts and Disk Space

Your session will timeout after four hours since login. Batch submissions must complete within 24 hours or the job will terminated. Each user has access to 200 GB of disk space on the Devcloud.

If you find that you are kicked off the Devcloud due to short bursts of inactivity, this can be attributed to your PC display going to sleep. Complete the following steps to avoid session time-out:

1. In the Windows search bar, search "**Display settings**." 
2. Select in the side-bar **Power & Sleep**. 
3. Under **Screen**, change both settings to **Never**. 

## 17.0 Determining and Allocating Memory Availability and CPU Count and Speed

Enter the following in a Devcloud Terminal to determine memory availability: 

```
dmesg | grep Memory
```

Enter the following in a Devcloud Terminal to determine CPU Count and Speed:

```
lscpu
```

When launching the qsub command, you can request additional memory: 
Note: Each job takes 2 slots, so when you request 10G, it's actually 10G*2 = 20GB.

```
-l h_vmem=10G
```


## 18.0 Devcloud Editors 

There are three available editors in the Devcloud terminal:
